Nicehash Windows Gui is very good and it takes care of everything. It benchmarks your CPU/GPU and then keep switching to the most profitable algorithm.

On linux there is not such nice option.

Niceprofit is meant to be used with [tpruvot's cpuminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi) to find your CPU hashrate for all algorithms and then select the most profitable with the up to date data from Nicehash API.
